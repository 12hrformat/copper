Copper is our own distro, not a rebrand of Debian or Arch. We build the
kernel, the libc, and the userland from source, and we write the parts that
make it *Copper* ourselves — the shell, the init system, the first-boot
setup. Arch and Debian are reference material, nothing more.

Copper has a twin: **Vortex**, a cybersecurity-focused distro built by the
same team, sharing the Copper base but aimed at security work instead of
general daily use.

---

## Where things stand

| Part | Status |
|---|---|
| `copper-sh` (shell) | Works. Arrow-key line editing, history, pipes, redirects. |
| Networking | Works — wired only. DHCP on boot, `ping`/`nslookup`/`wget` present. |
| `copper charge` / `copper rollback` | Ship in the ISO. Logic tested end to end off-ISO; not yet run on a booted system. |
| First-boot wizard | Reaches every question. Account creation had three separate causes, all now fixed with a fallback; a full clean run is still unconfirmed. |
| Shell starts in your home | Yes. Lands in `/home/<user>`, not `/`. |
| Text editor | busybox `vi`. `nano` is not built — it needs ncurses. |
| GUI | Not started — planned for later. |
| Base system (kernel, musl, userland) | Building from source, CI green end to end. |
| Bootable ISO | Builds successfully. Boots in a VM. |
| WiFi | **Not supported.** Wired drivers only, no `wpa_supplicant`, and a VM has no wireless NIC anyway. |

## What's in this repo

```
Copper Linux
├── kernel          — Linux from kernel.org, our own .config
├── libc            — musl, built from source
├── userland        — coreutils, busybox, grep, sed, tar, ...
├── copper-sh       — our shell
├── copper-init     — our init, lives at /sbin/init
├── copper-firstboot — first-boot setup wizard
├── copper          — copper charge / rollback front end
├── hotfixes.json   — the hotfix database `copper charge` reads
└── copper.iso      — bootable live ISO (VMware / VirtualBox / QEMU)
```

The build pipeline (`iso/build.sh`) is staged — `kernel`, `base`, `tools`,
`copper`, `rootfs`, `initramfs`, `iso`, or `all` — and skips a stage if it's
already built, so re-runs on CI are cheap.

**Kernel:** Linux 6.12.10 LTS, with a trimmed config: ISO9660, overlayfs,
tmpfs, devtmpfs, virtio/e1000/vmxnet3 NICs, ATA/SATA, ext4, ptys. Drivers
are built in, no loadable modules.

**Base:** musl 1.2.5, busybox 1.36.1 (static, with adduser, chpasswd,
mount, hostname), coreutils 9.5, grep 3.11, sed 4.9, findutils 4.9.0,
diffutils 3.10, tar 1.35, gzip 1.13, xz 5.4.6 — all compiled from source
and linked statically against musl.

Run it locally with:

```sh
sudo bash iso/build.sh
```

or check the Actions logs for a CI run. A finished build uploads
`copper.iso` (~57 MB) as an Actions artifact.

---

## copper-init

Our own PID 1, not systemd. It mounts the basics, sets the hostname, runs
the first-boot wizard once, then keeps a `copper-sh` login shell alive on
tty1. Lives at `/sbin/init`.

The live initramfs (`iso/live/init`) finds the boot medium and builds a
writable overlay — read-only ISO root, tmpfs on top — before handing off
to `copper-init`. That overlay is also the mechanism persistence will use
once it's built out.

---

## copper-sh

A small POSIX-style shell, written in C. Mostly builtins for now, so it can
do useful things before the rest of the userland is on the system.
Anything not built in falls through to `execvp` and runs from `$PATH`.

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `cd`, `pwd` | navigate, print working directory |
| `ls`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `grep` | inspect files |
| `echo`, `tee` | output |
| `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `ln`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `touch`, `chmod` | file operations |
| `whoami`, `id`, `hostname`, `uname`, `date` | system info |
| `history`, `type`, `which`, `env` | shell/session info |
| `sleep`, `true`, `false`, `clear`, `exit` / `quit` | misc |

Also handles `#` comments, single and double quotes, backslash escapes,
pipes (`|`), and redirects (`<`, `>`, `>>`). Ctrl-C kills the running
command, not the shell.

Build it:

```sh
make
./copper-sh
```

Install system-wide:

```sh
make install    # /usr/local/bin/copper-sh
```

## copper charge — hotfixes without a reinstall

The idea: a bug is found, someone writes the fix down in `hotfixes.json`, and
anyone running Copper can pull that fix onto their live system in place. No
ISO rebuild, no reinstall, and if a fix turns out to be wrong there is a way
back.

```sh
copper charge                  # apply every hotfix that applies
copper charge --status         # (same thing — no real dry-run mode yet)
copper rollback                # list available backups
copper rollback <backup_name>  # put one back
```

Both need root. Backups land in `/var/backups/copper/`, and every action is
appended to `/var/log/copper-charge.log`.

### Writing a hotfix

`hotfixes.json` at the repo root. One entry per bug:

```json
{
  "hotfixes": [
    {
      "id": "demo-banner",
      "file": "etc/copper/demo.txt",
      "fail_code": "THIS LINE IS BROKEN",
      "new_code": "THIS LINE HAS BEEN FIXED BY COPPER CHARGE",
      "description": "Demo: proves charge can find, back up and patch a file"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Short name for this fix, used in the log |
| `file` | Path on the **live system**, relative to `/` |
| `fail_code` | The exact text to look for. Its absence means "already fixed" |
| `new_code` | What to put in its place |
| `description` | One line, shown when the fix is applied |

### How it decides

- `fail_code` present in the file → back it up, then replace it. Repeat until
  the text is gone.
- `fail_code` absent → skip with `already fixed?`. This is what makes
  `copper charge` safe to run twice, or on a machine that already has the fix.
- File missing → skip, do not create it. `copper charge` never writes a new
  file; it only patches one that already exists.

There is no automatic failure detection. A human maintainer writes the entry,
and `copper charge` applies the text edits. Anything subtler than a literal
string swap does not belong in this format.

### Where it gets the database

`/etc/copper/config`:

```sh
HOTFIX_URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Copper-linux/copper/main/hotfixes.json"
BACKUP_DIR="/var/backups/copper"
LOG_FILE="/var/log/copper-charge.log"
```

Point `HOTFIX_URL` at a fork or branch to test someone else's fixes.

**If `/etc/copper/hotfixes.json` exists it is used and the network is never
touched.** The ISO ships one so `copper charge` is testable with no network
at all. Delete that file to go back to always fetching.

### Rollback

`copper charge` writes backups under `/var/backups/copper/`, naming each one
after the file it came from with `/` turned into `_`:

```
/etc/copper/demo.txt   →   etc_copper_demo.txt
```

`copper rollback` with no arguments lists them; give it one name to restore.
The current file is saved as `<name>.pre-rollback` first, so a rollback can
itself be undone.

### Notes and limits

- The live system ships busybox `wget`, not `curl`. `copper charge` prefers
  `curl` when it is present and falls back to `wget` otherwise.
- The rootfs carries no CA bundle, so `wget` runs with
  `--no-check-certificate`. That is fine for fetching a JSON file from a
  known repo over a link you already trust; it is **not** fine for anything
  security-sensitive.
- Both scripts are plain busybox `sh`. No python on the live system.
- Only the first occurrence of `fail_code` is replaced per pass.

## What's next

- A confirmed clean first boot: wizard asks everything, creates the account,
  drops to a `dragon@copper` prompt
- `copper charge` run against a real booted system, not just off-ISO
- WiFi, if we decide a VM-testable target is possible at all
- `copper charge --status` as a real dry run
- GUI — no timeline yet, comes after the base system is solid
- `~/.copperrc` init file for the shell
- Shell history persisted to disk
- Tab completion in `copper-sh`
