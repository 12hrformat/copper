## What Copper is

Our own Linux distro, built from source. Not a rebrand of Debian or Arch, and
not a respin of them: the kernel is upstream but the `.config` is ours, the
userland is compiled in our own pipeline against musl, and the pieces that
make it *Copper* are written by hand.

- real **Linux kernel** (6.12.10 LTS, from kernel.org) with **our `.config`**
- userland **built from source**: musl, busybox, coreutils and friends
- **our own** shell (`copper-sh`), **our own** PID 1 (`copper-init`), **our own**
  first-boot wizard
- **all the standard Linux commands**, real tools — no stubs, no placeholders
- boots as an **ISO** in VMware / VirtualBox / QEMU
- first boot personalizes like a real distro OOBE
- speaks to **drivers** (wifi, bluetooth, firmware) and reaches the **internet**

Upstream projects are reference material. Nothing gets packaged as-is.

# Read this part: the branch, and why it isn't on upstream

**Both previous PRs are merged.** Upstream `main` is now `7b4e5fd`
("Merge pull request #3 from farcrowx/copper-os").

**Current work goes on `untested`, on the `12hrformat` fork.** That branch is
staging: things land there untested, and only move to upstream `main` after
someone has booted them.

```
origin    https://github.com/Copper-linux/copper.git    (read-only here)
dragon    https://github.com/12hrformat/copper.git      (works — push here)
fork      https://github.com/farcrowx/copper.git        (push denied)
```

**Use `dragon` as the push remote.** `fork` was the historical target and now
answers `permission denied`; `origin` answers `push=False`. The credential on
this machine has no write access to `Copper-linux/copper`, which is why
everything lands on the fork first.

Work on `untested` so far:

```
b811a15 add 'copper' front end so 'copper charge' actually works
ab6c17f copper charge/rollback: fix three blockers, add a testable demo hotfix
22ffde5 fix: user creation, doubled banner, garbled typing, hardcoded prompt
7fe1450 firstboot: make stdout unbuffered
59ddc2d firstboot: fix invisible password prompt, give wizard a controlling tty
903e764 copper-sh: guard run_segments against n<1
8a73513 firstboot: fix bad read_line call in confirm-password fallback
007f6fd copper-sh: arrow-key line editing
```

**Landing it still needs somebody with write access.** Open
`12hrformat:untested → Copper-linux/copper:main`. Do not merge blind — G1 is
still open (a full wizard run has not been confirmed end to end).

The old `copper-os` branch has been deleted from the fork; its content lives
on as `untested`. `patch-1` is long merged and is history, not a target.

To pick up the work:

```sh
git fetch dragon
git log --oneline upstream/main..dragon/untested
git checkout -b untested dragon/untested
```

If a push is rejected with `fetch first`:

```sh
git pull --rebase dragon untested
git push dragon HEAD:untested
```

# Where things actually stand

**The box boots, gets onto the network, and runs the first-boot wizard.** A
VMware guest, 2 GB, NAT, booting the ISO, has produced this:

```
copper: initramfs up, medium is /dev/sr0
copper: handing over to copper-init
copper: eth0 is up, asking DHCP for an address
copper-net: eth0 leased 192.168.127.132/24
copper-net: default route via 192.168.127.2
copper-net: nameserver 192.168.127.2

===================================================
          Welcome to Copper Linux
===================================================
Your name: dragon
Username [letters, digits, - _]: dragon
Hostname [copper]: copper
Password (root):
...
```

That is kernel, initramfs, overlay, `switch_root`, our PID 1, DHCP, netmask
conversion, default route, resolver, and the wizard — verified on hardware,
from artifacts that were taken apart and read before being trusted.

## What has never run

1. **A complete, clean first-boot wizard run.** The wizard now reaches every
   question and creates the account by two independent paths (see below), but
   nobody has yet seen one boot go banner → all questions → `Done — welcome` →
   a `dragon@copper` prompt. Each stage was fixed and confirmed individually;
   the whole path has not been confirmed in a single pass.
2. **`copper charge` on a booted system.** The logic is verified end to end
   off-ISO (see below) but has never run against a live root.
3. **Real internet traffic.** `ping` to a host on the LAN works. Nothing has
   yet proved that a name resolves or that a TCP connection completes.
   `ping 1.1.1.1` and a `wget` are still unrun.

## The 310 empty files

The most expensive bug in this project's history, and the one whose diagnosis
went wrong three times before it was right. Worth reading, because the wrong
answers were all plausible.

**The symptom.** A booted system reported `ip: command not found` and
`ifconfig: command not found`. Both are compiled into the busybox that ships
in the image — verified by running `busybox ip -V` on the extracted binary.

**The truth.** 310 files in the ISO were **zero bytes**. `sbin/ip`,
`sbin/ifconfig`, `usr/bin/awk`, `mach_kernel` and most of the rest. An empty
file is present, so every existence check in the build passed, and `execve()`
cannot run one, so the shell reported "command not found" for commands that
were shipped and compiled in.

**Two wrong diagnoses, both mine, both retracted:**

- *"There is a `/sbin` collision."* There is not. The empties are spread
  across `usr/bin` (112), `usr/share` (66), `usr/sbin` (60) and `sbin` (70).
  `sbin` is not special. I asserted this while looking at a `sbin`-only
  listing.
- *"Files are owned by a user called `draon`, who should not exist."*
  `draon` was **me** — the WSL account extracting the ISO. ISO9660 has no
  per-file owner field, so p7zip stamps whoever ran the extraction. I built an
  entire theory, and nearly a fix, on my own measurement artifact. The WSL
  account has since been renamed to `dragon` so this cannot recur.

**The pattern that actually identifies it:**

```
bin/     empty: 0    symlinks: 92     <- pure busybox, untouched
usr/bin  empty: 112  symlinks: 15     <- damaged
usr/sbin empty: 60   symlinks: ?      <- damaged
sbin     empty: 70   symlinks: 1      <- damaged
```

`bin/` is intact because nothing overwrote it. Every damaged directory is one
where a later stage installed over busybox's applet links.

**The fix, and why it is not the fix I first thought.** `cp` follows a symlink
at the destination and writes *through* it. Adding `--remove-destination`
everywhere is correct and necessary — but note what it does *not* explain.
Tested directly, plain `cp` over a dangling applet link refuses:

```
cp: not writing through dangling symlink 'dest/ip'
```

It errors rather than producing an empty file. So `--remove-destination` is
defence in depth, and the actual producer of the empty files is still not
fully explained. **Treat the cause as unconfirmed.** What *is* confirmed is
that the build now refuses to ship the symptom.

**Two gates, both tested against a deliberately broken tree:**

- `assert_no_empty_files` — any 0-byte file in `$TGT` fails the build, minus a
  short allowlist (`/etc/motd`, `/etc/hostname`, `/etc/timezone`, `/var/log/*`,
  `*.uuid`).
- `assert_applets_work` — every command a person actually types must resolve,
  through `bin`, `sbin`, `usr/bin`, `usr/sbin`, to a **non-empty** file. This
  one is subtle and the subtlety was found by testing it: the obvious `-e` test
  is wrong, because a busybox applet link is relative (`ip -> busybox` with the
  target in `../bin`), so `-e` is false when resolving it from `sbin/` and the
  check silently skips precisely the links that matter. It now tests `-L` first
  and then resolves with `readlink -f`, and separately rejects both empty
  targets and links to nowhere.

Verified: healthy tree passes; an applet pointing at a 0-byte busybox fails; a
missing applet fails; and the check correctly rejects the actual broken ISO
above, naming `awk`.

## Account creation: the third cause

`Couldn't create user` has now happened on three separate boots, each time
from a different underlying fault, and the fix is deliberately layered.

Reproduced against **the busybox that ships in the ISO**, in a mount namespace
with a private `/etc` (busybox `adduser` hardcodes `/etc/passwd`; running it
directly on WSL rewrites WSL's real accounts, which has happened in this
project before):

```
groupadd: '' is not a valid group name
fatal: `/sbin/groupadd -g 1000 ' returned error code 3. Exiting.
rc=10
```

Two distinct faults in one command:

- **Without `-D`**, busybox `adduser` tries to set a password and calls into
  PAM, which is not in the image: `passwd: pam_start() failed, error 26`.
- **Without `-G <group>`**, it passes an *empty* group name to `groupadd` and
  aborts.

Neither reproduces on a normal Linux box with a normal `adduser`, which is
why this only ever appears on a real Copper boot. The command is now
`adduser -D -G <user> -h /home/<user> -s /usr/bin/copper-sh <user>`.

**And if that still fails, the wizard writes `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group` and
`/etc/shadow` itself** (`create_user_direct()`), creating the home directory,
populating it from `/etc/skel`, and starting the account with a locked
password before `set_password()` fills it in. A box with a root account and no
named user is broken; one with hand-written account files is merely unusual.
Three boots lost to this is enough.

## Landing in the user's home

Previously the shell started in `/`. `copper-init` now reads the username from
the first line of `/etc/copper-firstboot.done` **after** the wizard has run
(reading it before finds nothing on a first boot), and `chdir`s to
`/home/<user>`, setting `HOME`, `USER` and `LOGNAME` to match. If the home is
missing or unreachable it says so and stays in `/` rather than pretending.

Worth being plain about: this does not make the system safe. There is no login
in front of the shell — init goes straight to a root shell — so anyone at the
console is uid 0 regardless of the working directory. It is a small piece of
correct behaviour, not a security boundary.

# What was messed up, and what fixed it

Nine commits, and most of them exist because something was quietly wrong in a
way that looked like something else. Worth reading in order — several of these
cost a boot cycle each, and the reasons generalise.

## 1. The overlay directories were created before the tmpfs went over them

`iso/live/init` did `mkdir -p /mnt/upper/upper` and then
`mount -t tmpfs … /mnt/upper`. Mounting hides what was underneath, so the
overlay came up with no `upperdir` and died:

```
overlays: failed to resolve '/mnt/upper/upper': -2
```

Fix: mount the tmpfs **first**, then `mkdir` inside it. The whole staging
order is that one trick. `3ae61c1`.

## 2. CI shipped an ISO built from the *previous* commit

The nastiest one, because **the run was fully green**. `restore-keys:
copper-work-` deliberately restores the previous tree — that is what saves a
7-minute kernel build — but the stage guards were existence-only
(`[ -s "$TGT/boot/initrd.img" ] && skip`). Key changed, old tree restored, file
present, stage skipped. An ISO went out with an initrd packed from the old
`init`.

Fix: `stamped_skip` / `stamp_set` / `tree_hash` in `build.sh`. Every stage
stamps its output with a hash of its own inputs. `d9b1ce1`.

**Do not "fix" this by deleting `restore-keys`.** The fallback is not the bug;
it is what makes a warm cache survive an unrelated change. The stamps are what
make it sound.

## 3. `$0` is not a path you can hash after a `cd`

`SELF=$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)/$(basename "$0")` is pinned before the
script `cd`s, because CI runs `sudo bash iso/build.sh kernel` — so `$0` is the
*relative* `iso/build.sh`, and line 20 `cd`s out from under it. `cat "$0"` then
had nothing to open, and under `set -euo pipefail` that killed the script 14
lines after a successful 7-minute kernel build. `307d6b9`.

## 4. My own rescue check was a false negative

Added in fix #1, to turn "switch_root on a root with no init" into something
readable. It read:

```sh
[ -x /mnt/merged/sbin/init ] || rescue "no /sbin/init in the merged root"
```

`/sbin/init` is a symlink to the **absolute** path `/usr/bin/copper-init`.
Before `switch_root` does its chroot, an absolute symlink resolves against the
initramfs root — where there is no `/usr/bin` at all. So the test followed the
link into the initramfs, found nothing, and reported a perfectly good ISO as
broken. It cost a boot cycle to find.

Fix: test the binary, not the link. `switch_root` still gets handed
`/sbin/init`, which resolves correctly after the chroot. `b7facc7`.

## 5. …and the build gate I added to catch #4 made the same mistake

`[ -e "$TGT/sbin/init" ]` — which also *follows* the link, this time to the
**build host's** `/usr/bin/copper-init`, which does not exist. Dangling, so
"missing", so the first CI run of the new gate failed on a staged tree that was
fine. It uses `readlink` now. `0cf3fd9`.

Worth internalising: **`-e` and `-x` follow symlinks. Any check on a
Copper-created link must use `readlink`, or it is testing the build machine.**

## 6. Stale files survived in two staging trees

`build_initramfs` and `build_rootfs` both copy into a `$TGT` that may have come
straight out of the cache, and `cp` only ever adds. A file or directory deleted
from the source came back in the next ISO — and because the ISO stage stamps
the whole tree, it did that while *looking* like a clean rebuild. `rm -rf` the
initramfs staging dir; keep a manifest of what the overlay contained last time
and drop whatever it no longer claims. `0cf3fd9`.

**The manifest has to be built from `iso/rootfs-overlay/`, not from `$TGT`.**
My first version diffed `$TGT` against itself, which is the cached directory
that still holds the stale file, so it could never fire. A test now pins that:
it runs the old logic against the scenario and asserts the file survives, so
the test cannot pass on the broken version.

## 7. The serial console addition made the screen lie

`console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200` looked obviously right. It is not. **The
last `console=` on the command line is what `/dev/console` points at**, and that
is the only place userspace output goes. On a VM with no serial port, `ttyS0`
never registers, `/dev/console` has no working target, and the screen sits on
GRUB's "Booting up kernel" while the system boots perfectly out of sight. It
looks exactly like a hang. Cost hours. `971b6e5`.

Correct order is `console=ttyS0,115200 console=tty0` — register both, screen
last.

## 8. …which then made the serial log useless

Fixing #7 correctly left the file getting the kernel's half of the boot and
none of ours, and under `quiet` — the entry anyone actually boots — **0 bytes**.
Measured, not assumed.

So `say()` in all three places (initramfs, PID 1, lease script) now writes to
stdout *and* to `/dev/ttyS0`, guarded by `[ -c /dev/ttyS0 ]` so a machine with
no serial port does nothing. `9750dac`.

Practical upshot: **you never have to photograph or transcribe a screen
again.** Point the VM's serial port at a file and paste that.

## 9. DHCP was broadcasting into a tunnel

This is the one that mattered most, and it was hiding in plain sight:

```
copper-net: no lease on sit0 yet, still asking
udhcpc: no lease, forking to background
```

`sit0` is not a network card. It is the IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel the `sit` module
creates at boot, and with `MODULES=n` every driver is built in, so it exists
before the real NIC finishes probing. `first_nonloop_iface()` took the first
name in `/sys/class/net` that wasn't `lo`, so it got `sit0`, brought it up with
`SIOCSIFFLAGS`, and broadcast DHCP discovers into an interface that cannot
carry them. `eth0` sat there untouched and never even reported link up,
because nothing had asked it to.

Fix: read `/sys/class/net/<if>/type` (the `ARPHRD_*` value) and only accept
`ARPHRD_ETHER`, or `ARPHRD_IEEE80211_RADIOTAP` when there is no wired one.
That skips `sit0`, `gre0`, `ip6tnl0`, `ipip0`, `teql0`, `tun0` and `ifb0`
without naming any of them, and it no longer depends on directory order.
`2601222`.

The old code carried a comment predicting this exact failure. It was right, and
it was still worth doing properly.

# Goals

Ordered by what unblocks the most.

## G1 — Confirm the first-boot wizard ⚠️ blocks the identity claim

**Done looks like:** the screen after `copper-net: nameserver …` shows the
wizard asking for a name, and a `copper-sh` prompt afterwards.

Boot `copper4.iso`, screenshot the window. That is the whole task. Nothing
downstream — persistence especially — is testable until it is answered, and it
has never been executed, so expect it to be the next thing to break.

## G2 — Prove the internet, not just DHCP

**Done looks like:**

```sh
ping -c 1 1.1.1.1          # raw IP, no DNS
nslookup example.com       # resolver works
wget -O - http://example.com   # HTTP end to end
```

We have a lease, a route and a resolver. None of the three above has run. The
cheap version is to add a reachability probe to the lease script's `bound`
handler so the next log answers it without anyone typing commands; the honest
version is to run the three commands at a `copper-sh` prompt and paste the
output.

## G3 — Static-IP escape hatch

Some networks don't hand out leases, and a DHCP-only box is a box that can't
be used on one.

**Done looks like:** a `/etc/network`-style file (interface, address, netmask
or prefix, gateway, nameservers) that `copper-init` reads and applies instead
of starting `udhcpc`, when the file is present and non-empty. Missing file
means DHCP, as it does today.

## G4 — WiFi

Bigger than ethernet, because `MODULES=off` means the wireless driver and
`CONFIG_CFG80211` have to be compiled into the kernel `.config` directly.

**Done looks like:** the box associates with an access point and gets a lease
without manual fiddling.

Roughly: enable `CFG80211` plus the driver in `build.sh`; build
**wpa_supplicant** from source (static musl) for association; keep busybox
`udhcpc` for the IP afterwards, since it now demonstrably works; and drop the
card's firmware blobs (a `linux-firmware` subset) into the rootfs.
NetworkManager — glib and dbus from source — is the heavy end state for
roaming and a GUI, and is not required to get onto a network.

The interface-selection bug that broke wired DHCP is already handled for wifi:
`first_nonloop_iface()` now asks sysfs for the `ARPHRD_*` type and prefers
`ARPHRD_ETHER` over `ARPHRD_IEEE80211_RADIOTAP`, so a wireless NIC no longer
turns it into a coin flip.

## G5 — Bluetooth

**Done looks like:** `bluetoothctl` or equivalent sees a paired device.

BlueZ built from source, kernel `CONFIG_BT=y` with the relevant protocol
drivers. BlueZ wants a D-Bus daemon; that's the part to budget time for.

## G6 — Persistence

**Done looks like:** a reboot keeps your files.

The overlay's upper layer is currently tmpfs, so the session is throwaway by
design. Move the upper onto a real disk partition the user picks on the
wizard's last page — same overlay mechanism, different `upperdir`.
`iso/live/init` already lays the overlay down, so this is a matter of mounting
a disk where the tmpfs goes and telling the wizard to offer it.

## G7 — Land `patch-1`

See the top of this document. It needs a PR from an account with write access
to `Copper-linux/copper`, or someone with that access pushing it.

## G8 — A desktop

The long end. Worth saying plainly: it is far away, and nothing before it is
blocked on it.

# `copper charge` — what it is and how it got debugged

The hotfix system. `copper charge` pulls `hotfixes.json` and patches the live
system in place; `copper rollback` puts it back. Full user-facing docs are in
`README.md`. This section is the part a next person needs and the README does
not say: **every one of these was found by running the thing, not by reading
it.**

`copper-charge.sh` and `copper-rollback.sh` had never been executed by anyone
before today. Four defects, each of which made the feature completely
non-functional:

1. **`charge` called `curl`, which does not exist on the live system.** The
   rootfs ships busybox applets; there is no `curl` anywhere in the ISO.
   Checked by listing the artifact, not by assuming. Now prefers `curl` if
   present and falls back to `wget`.
2. **`rollback` could never restore anything.** `charge` names a backup by
   `tr '/' '_'`, so `/usr/bin/foo` becomes `usr_bin_foo`. `rollback` undid
   that with `sed 's|__|/|g'` — replacing a *double* underscore, which can
   never appear when `tr` emits one per slash. Every restore died with
   `target file not found`. Now `tr '_' '/'`.
3. **The only hotfix in the database targeted `src/main.c`,** a repo path that
   does not exist on a booted system, so even a successful fetch could only
   ever print `skipping … not found`. Replaced with a demo entry against
   `/etc/copper/demo.txt`, which the ISO ships.
4. **There was no `copper` binary at all.** The tools shipped as
   `copper-charge` and `copper-rollback`, so the command everyone would type,
   `copper charge`, returned `not found`. Added `/usr/bin/copper` as a front
   end, calling the tools by absolute path so a short `PATH` cannot hide them.

## How it is verified

Not by a green CI run — by running both scripts against a fake root in WSL
with the real ISO overlay files, as root, and reading the actual file contents
after each step:

```
copper: applied demo-banner — Demo: proves charge can find, back up and patch a file
copper:   backed up to .../var/backups/copper/etc_copper_demo.txt
copper: charge complete
  -> second run: skipping demo-banner — fail_code not in etc/copper/demo.txt (already fixed?)
  -> rollback:  restored etc_copper_demo.txt → .../etc/copper/demo.txt
```

Apply, backup, idempotent skip, and restore are all confirmed. What is **not**
confirmed is the same cycle on a booted system.

## Testing it offline

The ISO installs `hotfixes.json` at `/etc/copper/hotfixes.json`, and `charge`
prefers that file and never touches the network when it exists. So the hotfix
system can be tested on a VM with no working internet. Delete the file to go
back to fetching from `HOTFIX_URL`.

## A trap worth knowing

`busybox adduser` and `addgroup` write to the real `/etc/passwd` and
`/etc/group` regardless of `HOME`, `PWD`, or anything else. Probing them
inside a WSL shell **modifies WSL**. Back those files up and restore them in
a `trap`, or you will leave junk accounts behind. This happened twice here and
was cleaned up both times.

---

# What is verified, and what is not

Being precise here matters, because it is easy to mistake "it compiles" for
"it works".

## Has actually been executed

- **The boot path, end to end, on a real machine.** Kernel → initramfs →
  overlay → `switch_root` → `copper-init`. The log at the top of this document
  is the evidence.
- **DHCP against a real server.** A lease, `/24` derived from a
  `255.255.255.0` netmask, a default route, and a resolver. `mask_to_prefix`
  had only ever been unit-tested before this; it is now correct in production.
- **`copper-sh`** — compiled with real GCC 12.2
  (`-std=c11 -O2 -Wall -Wextra`, zero warnings) and run through a 44-command
  battery under **AddressSanitizer**: exit 0, no leaks, no overruns. Bugs that
  found and fixed: an argv heap off-by-one, output lost because `_exit()`
  skipped the stdio flush, history storing tokenized instead of the line you
  typed, children reading stale buffered stdin, `ls -l` on a single file, and
  `ls` going one-per-line on a non-TTY so `ls | grep` filters like real `ls`.
- **`tests/smoke.sh`** — 19 assertions over the shell's core behaviours. Run it
  before you touch the shell.
- **The DHCP lease script** — 58 assertions on `mask_to_prefix` (all 33 valid
  netmasks, generated rather than typed, plus non-contiguous and malformed
  input) and 25 more driving the whole script against a stub `ip`.
- **The stage-stamp logic** — 11 assertions including the exact regression
  (output present *and* input moved on must rebuild), and a separate harness
  proving the helpers survive `set -euo pipefail`.
- **The build gates** — overlay-manifest pruning against a simulated warm
  cache, the CRLF gate, and the `readlink` comparison, with a check that the
  *old* manifest logic fails the same scenario.
- **The logging paths** — all three `say()` implementations reach both the
  screen and `ttyS0`, with the `-c` guard proven to skip a non-character
  device.
- **The whole CI build**, green end to end — kernel, musl, busybox, all eight
  GNU tools, Copper's three binaries, rootfs, initramfs, GRUB ISO.
- **`sh -n`** on all three shipped shell scripts, plus at build time via
  `lint_scripts`.
- **`copper-init.c` and `copper-firstboot.c`** compile clean under GCC 12.2
  with `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wshadow -Wwrite-strings`, and in CI against
  musl.

## Has never run

- **A full clean first-boot wizard run**, banner to `dragon@copper` prompt in
  one pass. Each stage is fixed and individually confirmed. G1.
- **`copper charge` against a booted system.** Verified off-ISO only.
- **Any real internet traffic.** No `ping`, no `nslookup`, no `wget`. G2.

## A note on green CI runs

**A green run does not mean the artifact is correct.** Run `36220249701` was
fully green and shipped an ISO built from the previous commit's `init`. Always
take the artifact apart: mount it, `gzip -dc` the initrd, decode the cpio, read
`/init` back out, and parse the ISO's Rock Ridge records if you need to know
what a symlink points at. Windows shows 8.3 names because the image has Rock
Ridge and **no Joliet** — `COPPER_I` is `copper-init`, and that is cosmetic,
not a bug.

## The build gates

- `lint_scripts` — `sh -n` over the initramfs `init` and the lease script. Both
  are read by busybox ash on a machine with no shell to log into and fix them
  with.
- `require_kernel_config` / `require_bb_config` — read the `.config` files back
  after kconfig has had its say and refuse to continue, listing what went
  missing.
- `build_copper` — checks the staged tree actually contains the binaries and
  lease script `switch_root` needs, and that `sbin/init` is a symlink to
  `/usr/bin/copper-init`. Uses `readlink`, not `-e`; see bug #5.

---

# Traps that will cost you a day

**Any change to a cache-key file is a full kernel rebuild.** The CI cache key
hashes `iso/build.sh`, `iso/live/init`, `iso/boot/grub.cfg`,
`iso/rootfs-overlay/**`, `iso/src-init/**`, `iso/firstboot/**` and `src/**`. A
change to *any one* of those throws away the whole `iso/work/` cache. The cache
is saved even on failure (`if: always()`), so a red run still warms the next
one. Batch changes; don't dribble.

**The kernel command line's last `console=` is `/dev/console`.** See bug #7.
This is the single most counter-intuitive thing in the whole boot, it produces
a fake hang, and it cost the most time.

**`console=ttyS0,115200` on a VM with no serial port is not a no-op.** It
takes `/dev/console` away from `tty0`. Add the serial port *and* put `tty0`
last.

**Only add symbols to `require_kernel_config` that you have checked exist.**
A symbol that doesn't exist in 6.12 fails the build immediately and
expensively. `ETHERNET` is the cautionary tale: it was in the list, and 6.12
removed it.

**`MODULES=n` means every `tristate` resolves to `y` or `n`,** never `m`. So a
`--enable`d tristate really is `=y` in the final `.config`.

**`core.autocrlf` was `true` on the build machine** and quietly filled the
working tree with CRLF. A CR is invisible in a diff and it breaks things
quietly: a CR at the end of `PATH` in `/etc/profile` makes every command come up
"not found", CRLF in `passwd`/`hosts` breaks the lookups, and CRLF in a script
busybox ash runs turns every line into "command not found" during boot. It is
`false` now and `.gitattributes` asks for LF everywhere. Leave both alone.

**`git commit -- <paths>` commits the working tree, not the index**, which
leaks `update-index --chmod=+x` changes into a later commit. Use index-only:
`git reset -q; git add -- <files>; git update-index --chmod=+x -- <f>; git commit`.

**`core.fileMode` is off on Windows**, so exec bits need
`git update-index --chmod=+x`. `iso/live/init` and the lease script are mode
100755 and must stay that way.

# Config facts worth not rediscovering

Each of these cost a wrong turn once. All were checked against real sources.

- **busybox's `make defconfig` is not a stock config.** busybox patches kconfig
  with `const char conf_defname[] = "/dev/null"`
  (`scripts/kconfig/confdata.c:25`), so "defconfig" means *the Kconfig
  defaults*. There is no `configs/defconfig` in 1.36.1. Per-applet symbols live
  in `//config:config SYMBOL` comments inside the `.c` files and in the
  directory `Config.src` files.
- `CONFIG_STATIC` is `default n`, so it must be set explicitly — and **after**
  `make defconfig`, because reassigning a symbol defconfig already answered is
  silently dropped (first assignment wins). That's what `set_bb_config` is for.
- **6.12 has no `CONFIG_ETHERNET`.** The driver menu is unconditional under
  `NET`/`NETDEVICES`. Those are the real gates.
- In 6.12, `config INET` moved to `net/Kconfig` and `net/ipv4/Makefile` builds
  `tcp.o`/`udp.o` in `obj-y` unconditionally under `INET`. So `CONFIG_INET=y`
  (which `x86_64_defconfig` sets) is enough for IPv4.
- `BLK_DEV_NVME` lives in `drivers/nvme/host/Kconfig` in 6.12. It's `tristate`
  with **no default**, so the explicit `--enable` in `build.sh` turns it on.
- `CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS` is also `tristate` with no default. The entire live-root
  design rests on `build.sh` passing `--enable OVERLAY_FS`.
- vmxnet3's Kconfig path isn't `drivers/net/ethernet/vmware/Kconfig` in 6.12
  and the symbol name couldn't be pinned down. `build.sh` passes **both**
  `--enable VMXNET3` and `--enable VMWARE_VMXNET3`; kconfig drops
  whichever doesn't exist. Deliberately not asserted.
- **In busybox 1.36.1 udhcpc's source is `networking/udhcp/dhcpc.c`,** not
  `networking/udhcp.c` — the client was split into a directory. `ip` is split
  too: address parsing is in `networking/libiproute/`.
- The environment udhcpc exports comes from the DHCP **option** names. The
  consequence that matters: **`$subnet` is the netmask as a dotted quad**, and
  `$mask` is the same mask as a decimal uint32. Neither is a prefix length.
- busybox `ip` *does* accept a dotted mask after the slash: `get_prefix_1`
  (`networking/libiproute/utils.c`) falls back to parsing it as a netmask. We
  convert to a prefix length ourselves rather than depending on that.
- `udhcpc -b` does not exit — after its retries it forks into the background
  and keeps trying forever. So init can fire it and move on; no `-n` needed.
- udhcpc does **not** put `PATH` in the lease script's environment, so init has
  to set it before the exec.
- busybox installs udhcpc at `/sbin/udhcpc`, `ip`/`ifconfig`/`route` in
  `/sbin`, `ping` in `/bin`, `wget`/`nslookup` in `/usr/bin`, `switch_root` in
  `/sbin`. It does **not** install a lease script, which is why we ship one.
- `wget`'s `https://` is busybox's internal TLS. It encrypts but does **not**
  verify certificates. Fine for pulling a tarball, not for a login.

# Tooling and how to drive a boot

## Getting the ISO

Artifacts download fine now, using the Git Credential Manager token. Earlier
notes saying this returns 401 are out of date. Capture the token into a
variable and never print it:

```sh
out=$(printf 'protocol=https\nhost=github.com\n\n' | git credential fill)
tok=$(printf '%s\n' "$out" | sed -n 's/^password=//p')
curl -sL -H "Authorization: Bearer $tok" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/farcrowx/copper/actions/artifacts/<id>/zip -o iso.zip
```

## The VM

VMware Workstation, guest OS **Linux / Other Linux 6.x kernel 64-bit**, 2 GB,
2 processors, **NAT** networking (bridged may not answer DHCP), and the ISO on
the CD drive with **Connected at power on** ticked.

Then **Add… → Serial Port**, "This end is connected to" → **Output to file** →
`C:\Users\hp\Desktop\copper-boot.txt` (VMware insists on a `.txt` name and will
warn that the file does not exist; accept it, it creates the file) → **Connect
at power on**.

Boot the **verbose** entry while diagnosing. The `copper:` and `copper-net:`
lines now reach the file on *every* entry, so paste that file rather than
photographing a screen.

## Tooling on the build machine

- **Git for Windows** gives a real POSIX shell at
  `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`. That allows `sh -n` on the shipped
  scripts and — more usefully — unit testing shell logic with a stub binary on
  `PATH`, no VM and no compiler. Most of the tests in this branch were written
  that way. Don't assume there's no way to test shell here.
- **This box cannot create a symlink at all** — `ln -s` fails regardless of
  privilege, because Windows wants Developer Mode for native symlinks. So any
  test of symlink *behaviour* has to stub `readlink`; the real thing is CI's to
  prove, and it does.
- No local C toolchain: no gcc/clang/tcc, no WSL, no container runtime. C
  verification goes through Compiler Explorer's API, which is **glibc, not
  musl**, so it cannot validate musl-specific code. CI is the real oracle.
- PowerShell gotchas that cost time: no heredocs (write the message to a file
  and use `git commit -F`); inline `bash -lc` with quotes and `$` gets mangled
  (write a `.sh` and invoke it); `curl.exe` mangles JSON in `--data-raw` (write
  the body to a file, use `--data-binary @file`); nested `$'\r'` through
  `bash -lc` arrives as a literal backslash-r, so CR checks must live in a
  script file.

# Rules to keep

- Human-sounding commit messages and code. Nothing that reads like AI slop.
- Keep Copper's identity distinct. Arch and Debian are reference material, not
  packaging material.
- **Verification over vibes.** Compile clean, run the battery under ASan before
  claiming a command works, and never ship a fake or placeholder command. A
  command that exists but doesn't work is worse than a missing one, because it
  lies.
- **Read the artifact, not the CI run.** A green build has shipped a stale ISO
  here. It will again.
- When something is unverified, say so in the commit message and in this file.
  The gap between "it builds" and "it boots" is what this project has been
  living on, and bugs #4 through #9 were all invisible to the build.
